The example Spark starter applications in this tutorial were develop in collaboration with real people doing their real jobs.

Special thanks to:

- A paper plate design engineer - Central Indiana
- A café manager - Central Oklahoma
- A lacrosse coach - Northern Massachusets

## Welcome

- **Who is this for**: Anyone with an idea to solve a problem or make their hobby easier, but is unsure how to get started.
- **What you'll learn**: How to create a web application by simply describing it, like you would to a friend/coworker.

  - Basic familiarity with web browsing and GitHub navigation

- **How long**: This exercise takes less than 1 hour to complete.

In this exercise, you will:

1. Discover how GitHub Spark makes app development accessible to everyone, not just programmers
1. Select an example scenario and create your first web application
1. Refine and customize your app through conversation
1. Share your application with your workplace or community
1. Explore advanced features and underlying code

> [!IMPORTANT]
> GitHub Spark is currently in public preview. Please verify you have access or [request it](https://github.com/features/spark) before beginning.

When copying the exercise, we recommend the following settings:

- For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.

- We recommend creating a public repository, since private repositories will use Actions minutes.

If the exercise isn't ready in 20 seconds, please check the [Actions](../../actions) tab.

- Check to see if a job is running. Sometimes it simply takes a bit longer.

- If the page shows a failed job, please submit an issue. Nice, you found a bug! 🐛
