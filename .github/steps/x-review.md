Here's a recap of your accomplishments:

- Built a complete web application by just describing it!
- Customized your app's looks and functionality through conversation and Spark's recommendations.
- Shared your app with with a friend or coworker.
- Explored the actual code structure and discovered advanced development features!

### What's sparking next?
