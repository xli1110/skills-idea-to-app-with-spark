## Step 5: (Optional) Advanced Coder Features

<img height="150px" align="right" src="https://octodex.github.com/images/securitocat.png">

You're amazed at what you have built (and so fast), but what's happening behind the scenes?

Let's explore some of the more coder-oriented features. Maybe this is indeed the _Spark_ of something cooler to come. 🧑‍🚀🚀

Or... maybe you are a hands-on coder and want to change something manually. 👨‍💻

> This step is **100% optional**. You can skip straight to the end if you like.

### 📖 Theory: Easy Development Environment

Behind every Spark application, there is a complete codebase running in a cloud-based development environment known as [GitHub Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces), and naturally it is being managed with Git version control.

Like all Codespaces, you can open it and start coding manually just like you do on your normal projects. This provides several advanced capabilities:

- **Code Editing**: View the actual code and assets that power your application and modify it.
- **Copilot**: Use GitHub Copilot Chat for code assistance and explanations.
- **Repository creation**: Save your Spark project as a permanent GitHub repository for version control and collaboration.

### ⌨️ Activity: Explore the Codespace

1. Above the live preview, in the top right, find the toolbar. Click the **Three dot (...)** button and select the **Open codespace** option.

1. Wait for the codespace to load in a new browser tab.

1. In the left file navigation, open the `./PRD.md` file to view the notes Spark stores for keeping your application organized.

1. Expand the **Copilot Chat Panel**. Verify you are in **Agent** mode, then ask Copilot to change the application title.

   > ```prompt
   > #codebase
   > Please make the application's title more inviting.
   > Make sure it is updated in all places.
   > ```

1. Navigate back to the Spark page. Notice that the live preview is updated and a `Manual edit` entry was added to the left chat panel.

### ⌨️ Activity: Save to a Repository

1. Above the live preview, in the top right, find the toolbar. Click the **Three dot (...)** button and select the **Create repository** option.

   <img width="350" alt="Create repository button" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad91575a-0906-48e4-8f76-9d06ae95035e">

1. Click **Create** button to start a private repository under your GitHub account.

1. Wait a moment for the repository to be created then press the **Go to repository** button.

1. (Optional) begin collaborating with others in your regular style. 🎉

<summary>Having trouble? 🤷</summary><br/>

- If the **Open Codespace** and **Create repository** options are unavailable, please wait a moment and try again. Spark will temporarily disable these during important operations.
