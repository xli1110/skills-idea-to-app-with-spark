Your app is working well, and also looking great. Now it's time to let your coworkers and friends also enjoy the benefit. Spark let's you share your app without worry of someone accidentally changing it. Nice!

### 📖 Theory: App Visibility

GitHub Spark offers three visibility levels to control who has can use your application and share data.

1. **Only you (Private)**: Only your account can use the app.
2. **Organization**: Share with all members of a GitHub organization.
3. **All GitHub Users**: Accessible to anyone with a GitHub account.

> [!NOTE]
> There is no option for anonymous access (people not logged in to GitHub).

### 📖 Theory: Data Sharing

There are 2 ways to share application data with your fellow app users.

- **Read-only access**: Others can view and use your app.
- **Write access**: Users can both view and modify the app's stored data.

> [!TIP]
> In most cases, `read-only` access is probably the best choice. `Write` access is useful when a small group will use and modify the same data.

### ⌨️ Activity: Publish Your App

1. Above the live preview, find the toolbar in the top right. Click the **Publish** button.

1. Click the **Visit site** button or copy the address into a new browser tab.

### ⌨️ Activity: (Optional) Share Your App

1. Change the visibility to `All GitHub users` to make it available to anyone with a GitHub account.

1. Share the link with a friend or coworker to verify they have access.

1. Ask for feedback and ideas to make it even better! 🚀

- If the other person is not able to reach the application, check that they are logged in to GitHub.
- If the application fails to publish, wait a few minutes and try again.
