## Step 3: Style Your App

<img height="150px" align="right" src="https://octodex.github.com/images/gangnamtocat.png">

With your app working well now, it's time to do some styling to match your personal brand or design requirements.

Similar to not needing to know how to code, Spark also provides help with basic styling so you don't need to be an expert on color combinations and fonts. 🖍️

Let's explore some of the pre-made suggestions Spark offers to modify the feel of your app.

### 📖 Theory: Visual and Data Customization

Spark provides several ways to customize your application:

- **Theme customization**: Easy visual adjustments using the Theme pane to modify colors, fonts, spacing, and overall appearance
- **Asset management**: Upload and incorporate images, logos, or other files into your application
- **Data storage**: Spark automatically provides key-value storage for your app's data, with a built-in interface to view and manage stored information
<!-- - **AI capabilities**: Embed intelligent features like chat bots, content generation, and smart automation without complex integrations -->

### ⌨️ Activity: Personalize Your Design

1. In the left chat panel, at the top, click the **Theme** tab. This will open controls for changing the appearance.

1. Change the color theme to something like `Minimalist` or `Cosmic Latte`. Note: Spark may recommend you different options.

1. Experiment with the **Typography** to find a font that matches your app's feel.

1. If interested, use the **Color** area to override the Theme and manually set colors.

### ⌨️ Activity: Add existing files

It's very common to have existing assets, like a company logo school mascot image, or PDF document. Let's learn how to include those.

1. In the left chat panel, at the top, click the **Assets** tab to show a list of files (probably empty).

1. Right-click one of the below logos and download it.

   | Paper Plate Company                                                                                       | Coffee Shop                                                                                              | Lacrosse Team                                                                        |

1. In the left side panel, click the **Upload files** button and choose the logo image.

1. Ask Spark to use the uploaded image.

   > I just uploaded a logo. Please add it to the site.
   > I'll let you decide the best place to put it.
   > ```

### ⌨️ Activity: (Optional) View Stored Data

Sometimes it is nice to see the stored information and manually modify it. This area is a lightweight step into the technical side of Spark, so it is optional.

1. In the left chat panel, at the top, click the **Data** tab to show a list of data objects. Some are single values and some are tables.

   <img width="350" alt="" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daf55c10-755c-4394-a2b9-04d7b7a82584">

1. Click on a few of the items to open an editor for changing the values. Here are some examples:

   | JSON Document                                                                        | Table                                                                                |
   | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

1. Change a value in one of the tables, then click the **Done** button to save.

1. Check the application to see if it updated.

<summary>Having trouble? 🤷</summary><br/>

- If the theme options don't appear to be updating, try refreshing the page. Sometimes they get out of sync with the live preview.
- If an image no longer shows in the Assets list, don't worry. It wasn't removed. Spark probably moved it to a different place in the application. You can still mention it when chatting.

## Looking good? 🧐
